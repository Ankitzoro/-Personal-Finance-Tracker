## Personal Finance Tracker

This project is a comprehensive Python script designed to help users manage their personal finances efficiently. It provides a robust set of features for tracking income and expenses, analyzing spending patterns, and maintaining financial discipline.

### Key Features:

*   **Transaction Management:** Easily add new income and expense transactions, each recorded with a timestamp, amount, category, and type.
*   **Data Persistence:** All transactions are automatically saved to and loaded from a `transactions.json` file, ensuring your financial data is always up-to-date.
*   **Financial Summary:** Generates a clear overview of your financial status, including total income, total expenses, and a breakdown of expenses by category.
*   **Expense Filtering:** Filter and view total expenditures for specific categories, allowing for detailed analysis of spending habits.
*   **Budget Tracking:** Set budget limits for different categories and receive alerts when spending approaches or exceeds these limits, promoting proactive financial management.
*   **Category Validation:** Ensures that transactions are assigned to valid, predefined categories, maintaining data integrity.
*   **User Management:** Basic functionality to add users and associate them with their financial records (though the core transaction management is file-based in this version).

### How to Use:

1.  **Clone the Repository:** `git clone [your-repo-url]`
2.  **Navigate to the Directory:** `cd personal-finance-tracker`
3.  **Run the Script:** `PFT.py`.
4.  **Interact:** The script includes example test cases (commented out) that you can uncomment to demonstrate its functionality. You can also integrate these functions into a larger application or a command-line interface.

### Technologies Used:

*   **Python:** The primary programming language.
*   **`json` module:** For serializing and deserializing transaction data.
*   **`datetime` module:** For timestamping transactions.

This script is a great starting point for building a more advanced personal finance application.
